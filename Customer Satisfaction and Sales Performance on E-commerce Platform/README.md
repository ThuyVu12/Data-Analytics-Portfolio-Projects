This paper is dedicated to testing the relationship between customer satisfaction and sales performance using correlation analysis. 
The data used in this paper was collected and published by Olist Store, a large e-commerce platform in Brazil. 
The rating scores from the customers are used as a measurement of customer satisfaction, and the total sales of each product are used as a measurement of sales performance. 
The results show that there is a weak negative correlation between customer satisfaction and sales performance. 
In other words, customer satisfaction and sales performance do not always move in tandem. 
It can be concluded that customer satisfaction may not always be equal to customer loyalty.
The graphs and the tests in the paper were ganerated using R.
